# Console-Finances
## Description

### The Task

I was tasked with using Javascript to analyse a dataset and write to a console log. I decided to also add some basic text on the web page and added an image similar to what the user should see in the console. I've really struggled with the logic for this and have relied heavily on interrogating other student's work to ultimately understand how JavaScript behaves. I didn't know whether the approach they were taking would give the correct analysis so I have tried to understand things and create the code with what I see as the correct logic and arguments. The main part which made the most sense to me in another student's work was when I got to their greatest increases and decreases code as they had used index numbers as references in a second variable. As I'm used to using sql, this referencing of other IDs really clicked and s therefore referred to in the credits below.

## The requirements

Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset.

The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
(Total/Number of months)
The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
